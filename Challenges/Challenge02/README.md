## Introduction

As the name says, the purpose of Learn-a-bit is about learning one bit of code at a time.
In these events, you will build small projects to educate yourself on the fundamentals of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
These events are relaxed and non-competitive, but are still challenging enough to push you to use all your resources and knowledge to solve each problem.

## How does it benefit you?

Learn-a-bit will teach you the fundamentals through a hands-on approach. You will gain versatility in the basic tools of the trade and learn the best practices for writing semantic HTML and well-designed CSS. You will improve your design skills and start to create attractive and attention-grabbing portfolio pieces while also gaining confidence to tackle any of the harder hackathons.

## How does it work?

1. In the start of the challenge, you'll receive a picture of a component of a webpage with style guide instructions and [starter files](./starter-guideline.md).
2. You will recreate them as best as you can, either on CodePen or in your text editor. You can use your own colors and images, but the basic structure of the given example should be the same.
3. You will need to submit your re-creation by the given deadline with a LinkedIn post where you will:
   - Write about what you did
   - Tag @Mintbean
   - Paste a link to your code repo on GitHub or your CodePen
4. You will then share that LinkedIn post in the Discord #events channel.

## Resources
If you get stuck with any part of the challenge or have any questions, ask in the Learn-a-bit channel or the code mentor channels.

To find guidelines for codepen, GitHub, or other useful resources check

## What Happens After Submission
We will review your code during the next event and give feedback on some changes to promote best practices and clean code.
