    Level up bit by bit with Learn-a-bit
    
    As the name says, the purpose of
    Learn-a-bit is about learning one bit
    of code at a time. In these events,
    you will build small projects to
    educate yourself on the fundamentals
    of web development using HTML, CSS,
    and JavaScript. These events are
    relaxed and non-competitive, but are
    still chalennging enough to push you
    to use all your resources and
    knowledge to solve each problem.
